## Prisma Studio

Prisma studio is a tool that you can use to insert information into the database with a graphic user interface rather than running queries. It makes it very convenient to insert some test data or manipulate existing data.

Provided that you have done all of the steps to [set up your environment variables](./environment-variables.md) and have [migrated your database](./migrate.md) you should be able to open Prisma Studio with the following command.

```
bun studio
```
